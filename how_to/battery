CHECK BATTERY LEVEL
ENERGY_FULL/ENERGY_FULL_DESIGN shows how much the battery has degraded
throughout its lifetime.  CAPACITY is the current charge level.  STATUS
is either 'charging' or 'unknown' (AC).  This assumes the main battery
is BAT0.

    $ cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/uevent


SET CHARGE THRESHOLDS
Set the level at which to start and stop charging, assuming the main
battery is BAT0.  This makes charging start when the charge is less than
40%, and stop when the charge is over 80%.  Charges in between make the
computer run on AC.

    $ tlp setcharge 40 80 BAT0
