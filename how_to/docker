Start the docker deamon:
    $ sudo systemctl start docker.service


The Dockerfile file contains instructions for how to create an image.  It is
located in the root of the context.  Images are built from files rooted at a
given path (this is the context).  When building, the context is sent to the
deamon.

FROM x: sets the initial image from which to build.

RUN x: executes the command within the current image's environment.
Any side-effects caused by the command are incorporated into the image
and are seen by subsequent instructions.  Each RUN instruction effectively
produces a new image that can be built and run as a container.  They
are analogous to commits in source control.

CMD x: set the command to execute when the image is started.

LABEL x: add metadata to the image.

EXPOSE x: specifies which port the application listens to.

ENV x: sets an environment variable.  This is visible to all subsequent images.

ADD x: copies all files from the source directory to a directory in the
image's filesystem.

COPY x: copies all files from the source directory to a directory in the
container's filesystem.

ENTRYPOINT x: configure the container if it is an executable.

VOLUME x: creates a mount point for filesystems external to the container.

WORKDIR x: sets the working directory for RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and
ADD instructions.

ARG x: defines command line arguments passed to 'docker build --build-arg'.
