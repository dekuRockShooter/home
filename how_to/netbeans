MAVEN
1) Make a new Maven java application project.
2) In the "Name and Location" menu, group Id is com.deku, and Package is
com.deku.stuff.

This will make a project rooted at the given directory.  The pom.xml file
is the project's configuration file.

After building, run the app by executing the following in the terminal:
    $ java -cp target/project_name.jar com.pkg.LauncherClass

To build in the command line, run
    $ mvn clean # Remove any cached data from the previous build.
    $ mvn compile

To put compiled code in a JAR, run
    $ mvn package
